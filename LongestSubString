// Day -3
// Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
// Method: Sliding Window with HashSet
//
// Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to create a dynamic window that expands to include
// unique characters and shrinks when a duplicate is found.
// A HashSet is used to store the characters currently in the window.
// - If the character at `right` is not in the set, add it and update the max length.
// - If it is already in the set, move the `left` pointer forward and remove characters
//   until the duplicate is gone.
// This approach ensures each character is processed at most twice (added and removed),
// giving an efficient O(n) time complexity.
//
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(min(n, m)) â†’ where m is the character set size (e.g., 26 for lowercase, 128 for ASCII)
